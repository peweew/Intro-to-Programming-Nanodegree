# Lesson 4.4: Dictionaries

# Dictionaries are another crucial data structure to learn in Python in addition to lists.
# These data structures use string keywords to access data rather than an index number in lists.
# Using string keywords gives programmers more flexibility and ease of development to use a
# string keyword to access an element in this data structure.

# Strings vs List vs Dictionary Demo
s = "hello"
p = ["alpha",23]
d = {"hydrogen": 1, "helium": 2}

# Accessing items
print s[2]
print p[1]
print d["hydrogen"]

# Replacing values
s[2] = "a" # Will produce error, comment this line to continue with rest of code execution
p[1] = 999
d["hydrogen"] = 49
